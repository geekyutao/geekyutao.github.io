I am a Senior Researcher at Tencent, where I focus on reinforcement learning and game AI. My research interests lie in reinforcement learning, multimodal models, AIGC etc. My final goal of research is to develop intelligent agents that can perceive, think and behave like humans.

Before my current role, I earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), under the guidance of Professors [Zhibo Chen](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/chenzhibo/) and [Weiping Li](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37349978300). Additionally, I was a Research Student at the National University of Singapore (NUS) from 2022 to 2023, where I worked with Prof. [Xinchao Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/). Prior to that, I was a Research Intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) from 2020 to 2022, where I was mentored by Dr. [Cuiling Lan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/culan/) and Professor [Wenjun Zeng](https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?p=leader-Wenjun%20Zeng&tid=19&lang=en).

I like doing interesting projects. My recent project [Inpaint Anything](https://github.com/geekyutao/inpaint-anything) has received over 6.5k stars on GitHub. If you are interested in my work or want to collaborate, please feel free to contact me via email (yutao666@mail.ustc.edu.cn).
