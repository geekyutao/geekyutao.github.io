We introduce Inpaint Anything (IA), a mask-free image inpainting system based on the Segment-Anything Model (SAM). IA offers a "clicking and filling" paradigm, combining different models to create a powerful, user-friendly pipeline for inpainting tasks. It supports three features: Remove Anything, Fill Anything, and Replace Anything, allowing users to remove objects, fill holes with generative content, or replace backgrounds with new scenes.
